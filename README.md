# Solar-System
This project is a simple animated representation of a solar system created using HTML and CSS. It includes:

**A bright Sun positioned at the center.**
**1.** The Earth rotating around the Sun in a circular orbit.
**2.** The Moon orbiting the Earth.
**3.** Smooth animations to mimic realistic celestial movements using pure CSS keyframe animations.
This project serves as a creative visualization and demonstration of how animations and positioning can be effectively handled using only HTML and CSS.
